Problem: Library Management System

Design a library management system that handles books, users, and borrowing operations. The system should be able to:

Add new books to the library.
Add new users (members) to the system.
Allow users to borrow books from the library.
Allow users to return books to the library.
Display the list of books available in the library.
Display the list of books borrowed by a specific user.
Keep track of the number of available copies for each book.
Ensure that a user cannot borrow more books than the maximum allowed limit.
Your solution should include the following classes:

User: Represents a library user with attributes like name, user ID, and a list of borrowed books.
Book: Represents a book with attributes like title, author, and number of available copies.
Library: Represents the library itself, managing books, users, and borrowing operations.
